    This text is <ins>inserted</ins> using the ins tag. This tag semantically indicates content that has been added to a document, often rendered with an underline<br>
    You can alse specify a datetime attribute for uns to indicate when the content was inserted.<u></u> New content added on Jan 15. 2023</u></p>
    <h4>Strikethrough and Deleted Text</h4>
    <p>This text is<del> struck through </del>using the stag. This tag indicates content that is no longer accurate or relevant but should not be removed from the document. It's purely presentational

    This text is<del> deleted</del> using the del tag. This tag semantically indicates content that has been removed from a document, often rendered with a strikethrough

    Similar to uns, del can also have a datetune attribute<del> Old price: $20.00 New price: $24.99</del></p>
    <h4>Subscript and Superscript</h4>
    <p>chemical formulas often use subscripts, like H<sub>2</sub>O (water) where the 2 is a sch element</p>
    <p>Mathemetical expressions or ordinal indicators use supersxriprs,such as E=mc<sup>2</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup>,where the'2' and 'th'are sup ements.</p>
    <h4>Marked (Highlighted)Text</h4>
    <p>The mark tag is used to <mark>highlight</mark>or mark text that is of paricular relevance in the context of the surrounding content,often rendered with a yellow background.</p>

    another example:The theory was first proposed in <em>on the origin of species.</em>
    <hr>
    <h2>Code,Variables,And Prefomatted Text</h2>
    <p>These tags are crucial for displaying programming code,user input sample output,and presercing text formatting</p>
    <h4>Code Snippets</h4>
    <p>for inline code,use the code tag for example to print"Hsello World" in python,you would use<code>print("Hello world!").</code>

    <h3>Preformatted text</h3>
    <p>The pre tag preserves whitespace andline breaks exacly as they are written in the HTMl source code making it ideal for displating code blocks or ASCII art.
            <pre>Function example(data) {
                    if (if data==null) {
                        return "no data";
